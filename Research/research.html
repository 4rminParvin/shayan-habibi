                        Dense effluents discharged into the ambient water negatively influence the
                        local environment. Brine discharged from reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants is an
                        example of dense effluents on which I focused for my MS thesis. Researches have shown
                        that this type of effluents should be released into the ambient water using an inclined
                        nozzle below the sea surface. As a result, an Inclined Negatively Buoyant Jet (INBJ) forms
                        and propagates into the ambient water, as shown in the animation. In the following
                        paragraphs, I briefly explain some of the results obtained from Large Eddy Simulations
                        (LES) of INBJs Iâ€™ve performed.

                        I am eager to study fundamental turbulent mixing mechanisms responsible
                        for observations of the bulk flow behaviour. In this regard, I use the Q-criterion to identify
                        coherent structures of INBJs, as shown in the figure.

                        Since the sea bed is sloped in many regions where INBJs are usually
                        released, finding an optimum combination of nozzle and bed angles is of interest to
                        researchers. The figure shows that changing these angles significantly alters the
                        behaviour of INBJs.

                        After the INBJ impinges the bed, a density current forms on the bed and
                        propagates into the ambient. The bed slope could dramatically change the patterns
                        formed on the bed.
